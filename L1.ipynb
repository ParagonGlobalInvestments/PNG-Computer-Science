By 'compiled', we mean that translating C code into \n","    the 0s and 1s that underly every computer application is done directly by a program\n","    called a compiler. This compiler (such as GDB and clang, for C) is different\n","    from an interpreter (such as CPython, for Python), which \"reads\" the code and \n","    translates it into a script that can be more easily understood by the computer. \n","    Once we have this easier to understand code, we can then compile it using a compiler. \n","    Since C code can be compiled directly while Python code must first be interpreted \n","    and then compiled, it is a consensus that C code runs faster than Python. For this reason, \n","    you find many memory-intensive softwares (such as 3D games and flight programs) being written with C code. \n","    \n","    However, for this course we are coding in Python because it is a language that\n","    supports many Data Science and Machine Learning libraries and allows for easy\n","    string and array manipulation, unlike C. Because Python provides these conveniences\n","    and rids us of the burden of allocating memory and managing \"array safety\" \n","    (you'll understand what this means if you read more about memory management),\n","    we say that Python is \"further from the metal\" than C. That is, Python isn't \n","    concerned with many of the computer's physics and hardware limitations. \n","    Furthermore, there are other abstract languages built from C, such as Go.\n","    We won't go into these languages here, but you are free to study them if you'd like!\n","\n","'''\n","\n","# Running Code\n","\n","# First - Open and IDE (Internal Development Environment, such as Visual Studio Code)\n","# You can also use the built-in Python editor during this first class.
